## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Women in Technology's 2024 LaunchPad!!

Over the course of two compulsory days, you’ll work in teams (formed prior to the event) to choose from a selection of niche areas and solve complex problems. You’ll then have three individual learning days to refine your solutions, with guidance from our industry mentors.
The event will culminate in a final presentation, where industry professionals will assess your innovative solutions and provide valuable feedback.

This organisation will contain the repositories for all participants. Please ensure proper etiquette is upheld.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
