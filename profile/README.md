## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Women in Technology's 2024 LaunchPad!!

Over the course of two compulsory days, you’ll work in teams (formed prior to the event) to choose from a selection of niche areas and solve complex problems. You’ll then have three individual learning days to refine your solutions, with guidance from our industry mentors.
The event will culminate in a final presentation, where industry professionals will assess your innovative solutions and provide valuable feedback.
